# inf421-project
Projet INF421 - Ã‰cole polytechnique

Implementing various algorithms to enumerate polyominoes and solve tiling-related problems. School project.

What's new :
	-> dancingLinks algorithm adapted to serve exactCover problem with equivalence classes (To avoid using the same polyomino tile multiple times)
	-> Made generic in order to work with any type of tiling (2D, 3D, non-orthogonal) and any adapted data structure
	-> All tests for the tiling problems are in test.java. 2 examples, more to come
